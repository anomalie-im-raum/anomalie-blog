## Hi.

I am 'Anomalie im Raum' - a computer scientist specialised in cloud computing, software engineering, and data science. Other fields of interests are privacy and and security. Debian is my favourite operating system - because of the simple fact that "It just Works" and because of the attitude of the debian developers "We're done when we say we're done".
