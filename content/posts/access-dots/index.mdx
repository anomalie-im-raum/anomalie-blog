I use [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) on my cell phone, mainly for pragmatic reasons. My old Nexus phone died without warning and I needed a quick replacement. Fortunately, I had an older Xiaomi with Android One available, but the Android version running on it was outdated, so much for Android One phones getting updates.

In order to get the latest version of Android, I opted for a preliminary build of LinageOS. Expecting that there would soon be an official and supported build for my phone. This expectation has not been fulfilled.

Consequently, I won't get any update for LineageOS and additionally I can't lock the bootloader without wiping the phone. At least the apps running on the phone get updates from Google Play Store and [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/).

To summarize the situation: I'm aware that I have not the most secure and trustworthy system up and running. The situation is bearable for me because I have little sensitive data on my phone. 

To mitigate this situation, I use [Access Dots](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=you.in.spark.access.dots&hl=en_US&gl=US). This is an app that displays an indicator when the phone's camera, microphone, or GPS location is being used by any app, even if the app is running in the background. This is a useful feature that helps protect privacy.
