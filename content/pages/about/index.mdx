Hi!

'Anomalie im Raum' - a rather peculiar pseudonym, I admit - has recently embarked on the discovery journey of data science. People say I'm a good analyst and they like working with me because I act thoughtfully.

I like working with computers, that's why I studied computer science as well as software engineering. Through my work I have gained a lot of theoretical as well as practical experience in software engineering and cloud computing. Therefore, I know what "Generals do not stumble over mountains, but over molehills" means in real life situations.
